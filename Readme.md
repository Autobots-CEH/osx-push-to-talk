- Configurable device ([@jeremyellison](https://github.com/yulrizka/osx-push-to-talk/commits?author=jeremyellison))
- Tested with Mojave & Catalina

The icon indicator will be translucent if the microphone is muted.

Application Installer (dmg) can be downloaded in the [Release](https://github.com/yulrizka/osx-push-to-talk/releases) Section

## Troubleshooting

### The app is from an unidentified developer

The main reason the app is not signed is due to the costly yearly subscription of the Apple developer program.
I do not obtain it my self since I am not mainly an Apple developer.

To enable an exception for this app, follow https://support.apple.com/kb/PH11436?locale=en_US

If you want to be sure, just compile the project, Archive & export PushToTalk.app
